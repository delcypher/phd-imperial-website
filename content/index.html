I am a second year PhD student studying at Imperial College, London under the
supervision of [Dr. Alastair Donaldson](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~afd/) of the
[Multicore programming group](http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk) and [Dr. Cristian
Cadar](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cristic) of the [Software reliability
group](http://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk).  My work is generously funded by an EPSRC CASE
studentship in collaboration with [ARM](http://www.arm.com). 

I am currently interested in improving the reliability of
[GPGPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units)
programming using static analysis and symbolic execution techniques.

I received a MSc in Computing from Imperial College in 2012 during which I
contributed to the [KLEE](http://klee.llvm.org) project. Prior to this I did a
BSc in Physics with Industrial Experience at the University of Bristol. During
this I did a 1 year industrial placement at [SHARP laboratories of Europe
(Oxford)](http://www.sle.sharp.co.uk).
