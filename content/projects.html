Here are a list of projects I have contributed to

+ [KLEE](http://klee.llvm.org) - A symbolic virtual machine built on top of LLVM
+ [GPUVerify](http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/tools/GPUVerify/) - A static analysis tool for proving race, barrier divergence and assertion failure freedom of OpenCL and CUDA kernels
+ [KLEE-SMTLIB](https://github.com/delcypher/klee/tree/smtlib) - A fork of KLEE that supports using SMTLIBv2 solvers
+ [NSolv](https://github.com/delcypher/nsolv) - A front end for tools that use SMTLIBv2 solvers that can be used to launch multiple solvers in parallel
+ [SIMI-Qt](https://github.com/delcypher/simi-qt) - A GUI application (using Qt toolkit) for performing image segmentation on medical MRI images
+ [unrarall](https://github.com/arfoll/unrarall) - A small bash script to extract multiple rar files and clean up unwanted files from extraction
+ [iscp](https://github.com/delcypher/iscp-0.2) - A small bash script the automates downloading files from a server using ssh and rsync
+ [LLVM](http://llvm.org) - The awesome compiler framework
+ [Boogie](http://boogie.codeplex.com/) - A framework for static verification
+ [Whole program LLVM](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm) - A nitfy hack for getting the LLVM bitcode for programs
+ [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) - An SMT solver over the theory of arrays of bitvectors
